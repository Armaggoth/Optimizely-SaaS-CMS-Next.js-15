# This is a GraphQL query definition. GraphQL is a query language for APIs, similar to how SQL is for databases.
# Each query defines what data you want to fetch from the server.

query GetContentByGuid($guid: String) {
  # 'GetContentByGuid' is the name of the query. The part in parentheses defines the input variables.
  # Here, $guid is a variable of type String, which you provide when calling the query.

  _Content(where: { _metadata: { key: { eq: $guid } } }) {
    # '_Content' is the name of the data collection/table you are querying.
    # 'where' is a filter, like a WHERE clause in SQL.
    # This filter says: only return content where the metadata key equals the provided $guid variable.

    item {
      # 'item' is the field inside the _Content result. It represents the actual content item found.

      _metadata {
        # '_metadata' is a nested object containing metadata about the content item.

        displayName   # The display name/title of the content item.
        version       # The version number of the content item.
        key           # The unique key (should match the $guid you searched for).

        url {
          # 'url' is a nested object with different URL formats for the content item.
          base           # The base URL for the content.
          internal       # The internal URL (used inside the system).
          hierarchical   # The hierarchical URL (shows the structure/path).
          default        # The default URL for the content.
          type           # The type of URL (e.g., absolute, relative).
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
